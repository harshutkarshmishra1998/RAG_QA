RAG_QA is a production-grade document intelligence system that performs:
  1. Multimodal document ingestion (PDFs)
  2. Deterministic cleaning and normalization
  3. Structure-aware chunking
  4. Embedding and vector indexing (FAISS)
  5. Deterministic query transformation
  6. Multi-query retrieval with rank fusion
  7. Evidence-grounded answer generation
  8. Full provenance reconstruction
  9. Incremental pipeline processing
  10. Streamlit interactive UI
The system is storage-centric and pipeline-driven. Every stage produces structured persistent artifacts that serve as input for downstream stages.
