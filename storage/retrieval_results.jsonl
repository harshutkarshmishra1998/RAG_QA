At the end of this Time Period, the CI\u2019s system will have \ngenerated a Pending output file record for each ARE deposit account balance for which it does not have sufficient information to make an \ninsurance calculation. \n \n> The example below includes the processing of: \n A. One CD account from Anytown Broker, \n B. Marci Jones\u2019s three single accounts, and \n C. Two business accounts of XYZ Corporation. \n \nWhen the CI fails, the total current balance of the above six accounts is $2,520,000.

Only deposits for which \ninsurance determinations have been completed will appear in the Account output file; if an insurance determination cannot yet be made for a \nparticular deposit balance, the record for that deposit balance should NOT appear in the Account output file.

Alternative beneficiaries that depend on the death of primary beneficiaries are not taken into\naccount in calculating deposit insurance coverage, if the primary beneficiaries are alive.\n8 Deposits of an irrevocable trust continue to be insured under the trust account category even following the death of a \ngrantor. See 87 Fed. Reg. 4455, 4465 (Jan. 28, 2022) (\u201cThe merger of the categories also would eliminate the need for current \n\u00a7 330.10(h) and (i), which allows for the continued application of the revocable trust rules to the account of a revocable trust\nthat becomes irrevocable due to the death of the trust\u2019s owner.\u201d).\nFDIC \u2013 Part 370 Recordkeeping \nInformation Technology Functional Guide \nVersion 3.0\nPage | 25\n2) If a grantor is deceased determine if the FDIC\u2019s six-month rule applies. See 2.3.5. If it does, then continue to \nclassify the account as TST. If the six-month rule does not apply, then recognize the grantor\u2019s death for \npurposes of ORC selection and insurance calculation. Under the TST ORC:\na) If the TST is an informal trust (e.g. POD account) with two grantors, then after the first grantor dies and \nthe six-month rule expires, treat the account as a TST with one grantor.\nb) If the TST is a formal trust with two grantors, then after the first grantor dies and the six-month rule \nexpires, treat the account as a TST with one grantor.\n3) Identify eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\na) If all primary beneficiaries are deceased, then:\ni)  If there are no substitute beneficiaries named in the trust document for that primary beneficiary,  then\n(1) Funds associated with that trust account should be treated as funds in a single or joint account \nORC belonging to the trust grantor(s) and aggregated and insured with other accounts of the \ntrust grantor(s) in the corresponding ORC.\nii) If the trust document (or bank records for an informal trust account) indicates the interest associated \nwith a deceased primary beneficiary is passed to other beneficiaries (e.g., per stirpes9 or per capita), \ndetermine the eligibility of the successor beneficiaries and the total number of unique eligible \nbeneficiaries (including eligible successor beneficiaries) for purposes of deposit insurance calculation.\nb) If some primary beneficiaries are deceased and there is no contingency for the deceased beneficiaries,\nthen determine the number of eligible beneficiaries by counting the number of living primary \nbeneficiaries (identified in the trust agreement or, for informal trust, in bank records). For example, if a \nPOD account identifies three primary beneficiaries but one dies (without contingent beneficiaries), then \nthe trust has two eligible beneficiaries.\nc) If a beneficiary is ineligible,10 then the beneficiary should be ignored for purposes of deposit insurance \ncalculation under TST.", "metadata": {}, "rrf_score": 0.015625, "source_queries": ["What happens after a covered institution fails under Part 370 according to the High-Level Process at Failure section?"]}]}]}
