For account records not maintained by the bank, the third-party \naffiliates, brokers, custodians, et al. will be notified that access to the account has been restricted and all \ndeposit ownership data submitted to the CI must be as of the date and time of failure. Depositors should not \nhave access nor should any further transactions be allowed until the deposit insurance determination is \ncompleted.\nThe end-of-day processing described below and in 360.8 for sweep accounts will allow the reconcilement of \nin-flight transactions that occurred before the designated time of failure.\nStep 2: Notify Fiduciaries for Alternative Recordkeeping Accounts\nMajor Activity: The FDIC will notify all fiduciaries listed on the most recent optional Alternative \nRecordkeeping Entity Report to request deposit account records in the format outlined in the Part 370 \naddendum to the Deposit Broker\u2019s Processing Guide (Appendix D to this Guide).

At failure, however, the initial aggregation discussed herein allows immediate \nliquidity for depositors with low-dollar accounts and alleviates system processing time. When the broker and \nother third-party files are received, all deposit accounts will be aggregated by ORC. The FDIC will use the CI\u2019s \nIT system to calculate deposit insurance as follows.\n\u2022 \nInitial Aggregation by Depositor: The first aggregation is done by the CI at the depositor level. If the \ndepositor\u2019s aggregate balance at a CI is no more than the SMDIA, then all the funds the account \nholder has at a CI are fully insured and do not require aggregation by ownership right and capacity. \nHowever, as iterative processing of accounts occurs past the initial aggregation, all accounts should \nbe aggregated on an iterative basis to ensure there is no overpayment of insurance and to identify \naccounts by ownership right and capacity that might increase above SMDIA as new account \ninformation comes in.\n\u2022 \nAggregation by Ownership Right & Capacity: The second step of aggregation is at the ORC level. If a \ndepositor\u2019s aggregate balances exceed the SMDIA, the balances must be aggregated by ORC for a \ndeposit insurance determination, as required by law.\n\u2022 \nCalculate Insurance: Calculate insurance as outlined in Section 4 of this Guide.\n\u2022 \nRelease funds up to the SMDIA: Insured funds will be released iteratively as the insurance \ndeterminations are completed. The hold on the estimated uninsured amount will remain, i.e., a \npartial hold, until all pending files are processed.

Under Part 370, the Cl is required to maintain complete\nand accurate depositor information and to configure its IT systems to calculate the amount of deposit insurance\ncoverage available for each deposit account in the event of the Cl\u2019s failure. After the Cl\u2019s failure, the FDIC would be\nappointed receiver and would use the Cl\u2019s records and IT systems to facilitate the deposit insurance\ndetermination.\n\n2.1 Background\n\nIn November 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule requiring large Insured Depository Institutions (\u201cIDIs\u201d) with two\nmillion or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate information needed by the FDIC to determine\ndeposit insurance coverage for each deposit account, except as otherwise provided. Each Cl must also configure\nits IT systems to be capable of calculating the insured and uninsured amounts in each deposit account by\nownership right and capacity, which would be used by the FDIC to make deposit insurance determinations in the\nevent of the Cl\u2019s failure.\n\nPlease refer to the final rule at 81 FR 87734 (December 5, 2016) and the supplementary information contained\ntherein for more information.\n\n2.2 Key Concepts\n\n2.2.1 Deposit insurance coverage has increased over time\n\nDeposit insurance was established through the Banking Act of 1933 with a standard maximum deposit insurance\namount (\u201cSMDIA\u201d) of $2,500. As the economy and banking industry evolved, Congress and the FDIC recognized\nthe need for additional coverage. Consequently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and relevant regulations have\nbeen amended to both increase the SMDIA and provide for additional coverage through the creation of different\nownership rights and capacities. Congress most recently raised the SMDIA to $250,000 in 2010.\n\n2.2.2 Prompt access to insured deposits is essential\n\nConfidence in the FDIC is critical to the public\u2019s confidence in the banking system. No depositor has lost a single\npenny of insured deposits since the FDIC was established in 1933. Of equal importance, the FDIC is required to\nmake funds available to depositors as soon as possible, often by the next business day after an IDI fails.\n\n2.2.3. Depositors are insured separately at each IDI\n\nWhile each depositor\u2019s insurance coverage is limited to the SMDIA for each ORC, each depositor is insured\nseparately at each IDI. A depositor\u2019s coverage in a category at one IDI does not affect the depositor\u2019s coverage in\nthat same insurance category for an account at a different IDI.\n\n2.2.4 FDIC relies on the Cl\u2019s deposit account records\n\nIn the event of the failure of a Cl, the FDIC relies upon the deposit account records of the Cl to determine the\nownership of deposits and thereby the amount of the deposit insurance coverage available to each depositor. If\nthe records are complete, clear, and unambiguous, then those records shall be considered binding on the\ndepositor, and the FDIC shall consider no other records on how the deposits are owned.\n\n2.2.5 Depositors are insured in different ownership \u201crights and capacities\u201d\n\nDeposit insurance coverage is provided for deposits held in the different ORCs.

Appendix A\nidentifies the data fields that may be populated with a null value. Part 370 requires that each Cl will provide all\ninformation described in Appendix A unless noted otherwise. If a data field is allowed a null value per Appendix A, it\nshould be represented by two consecutive pipe delimiters and the account should not be placed in the Pending File.\n\nAll Output Files contain the CS_Unique_ID field which should be unique to each Cl depositor and provide a common\nkey linking all files. The Account Participant File is linked to the Account File by the CS_Unique_ID, the\nDP_Right_Capacity, and the DP_Acct_Identifier. The file relationships should conform to the following rules:\n\n\u2014 _ Each account represented in the Account File or the Account Participant File should have a corresponding\ncustomer record in the Customer File.\n\n\u2014 _ Each account represented on the Account Participant File should have a corresponding account on the Account\nFile.\n\n\u2014 _ Each Account on the Pending File should not appear on the Account File, except in the case of pass-through\naccounts.\n\n\u2014 Each Account Participant that is also a Customer of the Cl should have the same AP_Participant_ID as its\nCS_Unique_ID at the Cl.\n\nFor alternative record-keeping files, the CS_GOVT_ID, namely the social security number or tax identification number\nshould be the preferred linking field.
