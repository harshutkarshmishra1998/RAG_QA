    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the high-level process steps performed after a covered institution fails under Part 370 are as follows:\n\n1. Determine the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts at the CI allocated to eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\n2. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of an account holder is five or fewer or if all primary beneficiaries have equal interest in the grantor’s trust account, then:\n   a) If the total amount of the grantor’s interest does not exceed SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then all of the grantor’s revocable trust funds at the CI are fully insured.\n   b) If the total amount of the grantor’s interest is greater than SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then the excess is the uninsured amount for the account holder.\n3. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of a grantor is six or more and all the beneficiaries do not have equal interest in the trust, then:\n   a) Calculate the insured and uninsured amount for the funds associated with each beneficiary based on the aggregate dollar allocation from each grantor to each eligible unique beneficiary.\n   b) If the total amount of the grantor exceeds the insured amount calculated based on the above, the excess is the uninsured amount for the grantor.\n4. For all funds that do not meet the requirements for the REV ORC, aggregate and calculate deposit in the SGL ORC.\n5. If there are uninsured funds for the grantor in either the REV or other ORC, then apply debits.\n6. Record the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account.\n7. The insured amount of the grantor for each associated account is the difference between the grantor’s interests in that account and the uninsured amount calculated based on the steps above.\n\nThe High-Level Process at Failure section describes the steps to be taken after a covered institution fails under Part 370, which involves determining the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts, calculating the insured and uninsured amount for each beneficiary, and applying debits to uninsured funds.\n\nAccording to Part 370, the following activities must be completed within 24 hours after a bank failure:\n\n- Determine the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts at the CI allocated to eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\n- Calculate the insured and uninsured amount for each beneficiary based on the aggregate dollar allocation from each grantor to each eligible unique beneficiary.\n- Apply debits to uninsured funds.\n- Record the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account.\n- Calculate the insured amount for each individual account as the sum of the current balance and accrued interest, less the uninsured amount, and then record the insured amount for each account.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] 370 — pages 20-21, 25\n",
