    "answer": "\n\nQUESTION 1:\nWhat are the high-level process steps performed after a covered institution fails under Part 370\n\nANSWER:\nBased on the provided context and sources, the high-level process steps performed after a covered institution fails under Part 370 are:\n\n1. Determine the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts at the CI allocated to eligible unique primary beneficiaries (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n2. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of an account holder is five or fewer or if all primary beneficiaries have equal interest in the grantor's trust account, then:\n   a) If the total amount of the grantor's interest does not exceed SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then all of the grantor's revocable trust funds at the CI are fully insured (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n   b) If the total amount of the grantor's interest is greater than SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then the excess is the uninsured amount for the account holder (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n3. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of a grantor is six or more and all the beneficiaries do not have equal interest in the trust, then:\n   a) Calculate the insured and uninsured amount for the funds associated with each beneficiary based on the aggregate dollar allocation from each grantor to each eligible unique beneficiary (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n   b) If the total amount of the grantor exceeds the insured amount calculated based on the above, the excess is the uninsured amount for the grantor (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n4. For all funds that do not meet the requirements for the REV ORC, aggregate and calculate deposit in the SGL ORC (4.1.2, SOURCE [1]).\n5. If there are uninsured funds for the grantor in either the REV or other ORC, then apply debits (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n6. Record the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n7. Calculate the insured amount of the grantor for each associated account as the difference between the grantor's interests in that account and the uninsured amount (4.1.4.3, SOURCE [1]).\n\nAdditionally, the process steps for single ownership accounts are:\n\n1. Identify all single-ownership accounts and the beneficial owners of the deposits in these accounts (4.1.2.2, SOURCE [1]).\n2. Aggregate total account balance and accrued interest by each unique beneficial owner for all deposits held by the owner in the single account right and capacity at the CI (4.1.2.2, SOURCE [1]).\n3. For the aggregated account balance and accrued interest for each beneficial owner:\n   a) If the total balance plus accrued interest does not exceed SMDIA, then the funds are fully insured and the insured amount for each account is equal to the sum of the balance and accrued interest (4.1.2.2, SOURCE [1]).\n   b) If the total balance plus accrued interest exceeds SMDIA, then funds in excess of SMDIA are not insured (4.1.2.2, SOURCE [1]).\n4. If there are uninsured funds for the account holder, then apply debits (4.1.2.2, SOURCE [1]).\n5. Record the respective uninsured amount to each account for the account holder (4.1.2.2, SOURCE [1]).\n6. Calculate the insured amount for each individual account as the sum of the current balance and accrued interest, less the uninsured amount, and then record the insured amount for each account (4.1.2.2, SOURCE [1]).\n\nAnd the process steps for joint accounts are:\n\n1. Determine if an account meets FDIC requirements for a qualifying joint account (4.1.3.1, SOURCE [1]).\n2. If the account is a qualifying joint account, then:\n   a) Verify all co-owners are “natural persons” (defined as human beings) (4.1.3.1, SOURCE [1]).\n   b) Determine all co-owners have equal withdrawal rights (4.1.3.1, SOURCE [1]).\n   c) Verify all co-owners have signed the signature card, or have satisfied the signature requirement (4.1.3.1, SOURCE [1]).\n3. If the account does not qualify as a joint account, then:\n   a) For accounts that include one or more co-owners that are not natural persons, the funds should be treated as jointly owned by the remaining natural person co-owners (4.1.3, SOURCE [1]).\n   b) If only one natural person owner is present, then the account should be treated as a single ownership account (4.1.3, SOURCE [1]).\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] 370 — pages 20-21, 25\n\n============================================================\n\nQUESTION 2:\nwhat is described in the High-Level Process at Failure section\n\nANSWER:\nInsufficient evidence in retrieved context to answer this question.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] 370 — pages 20-21, 25\n\n============================================================\n\nQUESTION 3:\nWhat activities must be completed within 24 hours after a bank failure according to Part 370\n\nANSWER:\nInsufficient evidence in retrieved context to answer this question.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] 370 — pages 20, 23, 25",

Determine the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts at the CI allocated to eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\n2. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of an account holder is five or fewer or if all primary beneficiaries have equal interest in the grantor's trust account, then:\n   a. If the total amount of the grantor's interest does not exceed SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then all of the grantor's revocable trust funds at the CI are fully insured.\n   b. If the total amount of the grantor's interest is greater than SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then the excess is the uninsured amount for the account holder.\n3. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of a grantor is six or more and all the beneficiaries do not have equal interest in the trust, then:\n   a. Calculate the insured and uninsured amount for the funds associated with each beneficiary based on the aggregate dollar allocation from each grantor to each eligible unique beneficiary.\n   b. If the total amount of the grantor exceeds the insured amount calculated based on the above, the excess is the uninsured amount for the grantor.\n4. For all funds that do not meet the requirements for the REV ORC, aggregate and calculate deposit in the SGL ORC.\n5. If there are uninsured funds for the grantor in either the REV or other ORC, then apply debits.\n6. Record the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account.\n7. The insured amount of the grantor for each associated account is the difference between the grantor's interests in that account and the uninsured amount calculated based on the steps above.\n8. If all single ownership accounts have been processed through Section 4.1.2.1 Right and Capacity and SMDIA Calculation or placed in the Pending File, then:\n   a. Identify all single-ownership accounts and the beneficial owners of the deposits in these accounts.\n   b. Aggregate total account balance and accrued interest by each unique beneficial owner for all deposits held by the owner in the single account right and capacity at the CI.\n   c. For the aggregated account balance and accrued interest for each beneficial owner:\n      i. If the total balance plus accrued interest does not exceed SMDIA, then the funds are fully insured and the insured amount for each account is equal to the sum of the balance and accrued interest.\n      ii. If the total balance plus accrued interest exceeds SMDIA, then funds in excess of SMDIA are not insured.\n   d. If there are uninsured funds for the account holder, then apply debits.\n   e. Based on the above calculation, record the respective uninsured amount to each account for the account holder.\n   f. Calculate the insured amount for each individual account as\n\n============================================================\n\nQUESTION 2:\nwhat is described in the High-Level Process at Failure section\n\nANSWER:\nThe High-Level Process at Failure section is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the context is discussing the process for determining deposit insurance coverage for various types of accounts, including single ownership accounts, joint accounts, and trust accounts.\n\nThe process involves several steps, including:\n\n1. Identifying the account type and determining the applicable ownership right and capacity (ORC) code.\n2. Calculating the insured amount for each account based on the account balance and accrued interest.\n3. Aggregating account balances and accrued interest for each beneficial owner or account holder.\n4. Determining the uninsured amount for each account holder.\n5. Recording the insured and uninsured amounts for each account.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about the High-Level Process at Failure section, it is difficult to provide a detailed answer.\n\n============================================================\n\nQUESTION 3:\nWhat activities must be completed within 24 hours after a bank failure according to Part 370\n\nANSWER:\nInsufficient evidence.

    "answer": "\n\nQUESTION 1:\nWhat are the high-level process steps performed after a covered institution fails under Part 370\n\nANSWER:\nAfter a covered institution fails under Part 370, the following high-level process steps are performed: [1]\n1. **Determine the Ownership Right and Capacity (ORC) for each deposit account**: This involves identifying the correct ORC based on account titling, and cross-checking with service charge codes for business accounts and codes for public institution accounts. [1]\n2. **Identify single accounts and determine their ORC**: Single accounts are those titled in an individual's name, and may include personal checking and savings accounts, \"doing business as\" deposits, and accounts established for the \"estate of\" a deceased party. [1]\n3. **Calculate the insured amount for single accounts**: For single accounts, the account holder is entitled to SMDIA (Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount) for the combined amount of their interests in all single accounts at the same covered institution. [1]\n4. **Aggregate and calculate deposit insurance coverage for revocable trust accounts**: For revocable trust accounts, the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts at the covered institution are allocated to eligible unique primary beneficiaries. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries is five or fewer, or if all primary beneficiaries have equal interest in the grantor's trust account, the grantor's revocable trust funds are fully insured. [1]\n5. **Calculate the insured and uninsured amount for each beneficiary in revocable trust accounts**: If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries is six or more and all the beneficiaries do not have equal interest in the trust, the insured and uninsured amount for each beneficiary is calculated based on the aggregate dollar allocation from each grantor to each eligible unique beneficiary. [1]\n6. **Aggregate and calculate deposit insurance coverage for single ownership accounts**: For single ownership accounts, the total account balance and accrued interest by each unique beneficial owner are aggregated, and the insured amount for each account is calculated as the sum of the balance and accrued interest, up to SMDIA. [1]\n7. **Apply debits for uninsured funds**: If there are uninsured funds for the account holder, debits are applied to the account. [1]\n8. **Record the respective uninsured and insured amounts for each account**: The uninsured and insured amounts for each account are recorded, and the insured amount for each individual account is calculated as the sum of the current balance and accrued interest less the uninsured amount. [1]\n9. **Determine if an account meets FDIC requirements for a qualifying joint account**: Joint accounts are those with two or more co-owners, and must meet specific requirements, including that all co-owners are natural persons, have equal withdrawal rights, and have signed the signature card or satisfied the signature requirement. [1]\n10. **Calculate the insured amount for qualifying joint accounts**: For qualifying joint accounts, the credit balance is insured in the JNT ORC, and the insured amount is calculated as the sum of the balance and accrued interest, up to SMDIA. [1]\n11. **Record the respective uninsured and insured amounts for each joint account**: The uninsured and insured amounts for each joint account are recorded, and the insured amount for each individual account is calculated as the sum of the current balance and accrued interest less the uninsured amount.

[1]\nThe process involves the following steps: [1]\n1. **Determine the Ownership Right and Capacity (ORC)**: The correct ORC must be determined from the deposit account records for each deposit account. This can be done by identifying the account holder, checking the account titling, and cross-checking with service charge codes for business accounts and codes for public institution accounts. [1]\n2. **Identify Single Accounts**: Determine if an account meets FDIC requirements for a single account. This involves identifying the account holder, checking if there are multiple account holders, and referring to other sections of the document for joint accounts, trust accounts, and certain retirement accounts. [1]\n3. **Calculate Deposit Insurance Coverage**: For single accounts, calculate the insured amount by aggregating the total account balance and accrued interest by each unique beneficial owner. If the total balance plus accrued interest does not exceed the Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount (SMDIA), the funds are fully insured. If the total balance plus accrued interest exceeds SMDIA, funds in excess of SMDIA are not insured. [1]\n4. **Apply Debits**: If there are uninsured funds for the account holder, apply debits to the account. [1]\n5. **Record Uninsured and Insured Amounts**: Record the respective uninsured amount to each account for the account holder and calculate the insured amount for each individual account as the sum of the current balance and accrued interest less the uninsured amount. [1]\n6. **Determine Eligibility for Additional Deposit Insurance Coverage**: Determine if an account meets FDIC requirements for eligibility for additional deposit insurance coverage under 12 CFR 330.10. [1]\n7. **Aggregate and Calculate Deposit Insurance Coverage**: Aggregate and calculate deposit insurance coverage for all funds that do not meet the requirements for the REV ORC and aggregate and calculate deposit insurance coverage in the SGL ORC. [1]\n8. **Record Uninsured and Insured Amounts**: Record the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account and calculate the insured amount of the grantor for each associated account as the difference between the grantor's interests in that account and the uninsured amount calculated based on the steps above.

Identify all grantors and all unique primary beneficiaries for each revocable trust account. [1]\n2. Determine if a grantor is deceased and if the FDIC's six-month rule applies. If it does, continue to classify the account as TST. If it does not, recognize the grantor's death for purposes of ORC selection and insurance calculation. [1]\n3. Identify eligible unique primary beneficiaries. If all primary beneficiaries are deceased, determine the eligibility of successor beneficiaries and the total number of unique eligible beneficiaries for purposes of deposit insurance calculation. [1]\n4. Determine the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts at the CI allocated to eligible unique primary beneficiaries. [1]\n5. Calculate the insured and uninsured amount for the funds associated with each beneficiary based on the aggregate dollar allocation from each grantor to each eligible unique beneficiary. [1]\n6. For all funds that do not meet the requirements for the REV ORC, aggregate and calculate deposit in the SGL ORC. [1]\n7. Apply debits to any uninsured funds for the grantor in either the REV or other ORC. [1]\n8. Record the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account. [1]\n9. Calculate the insured amount of the grantor for each associated account by subtracting the uninsured amount from the grantor's interests in that account.

[1]\nThe process involves the following steps: [1]\n1. **Identify Single Accounts**: Determine if an account meets FDIC requirements for a single account by identifying the account holder and verifying that the account is not a joint account, trust account, or other type of account that requires special handling. [1]\n2. **Determine Ownership Right and Capacity (ORC)**: Assign an ORC to each account based on the account holder's status, such as individual, trust, or business. [1]\n3. **Aggregate Funds**: Aggregate the funds in single accounts held by the same account holder at the same bank. [1]\n4. **Calculate Deposit Insurance Coverage**: Calculate the deposit insurance coverage for each account holder based on the aggregate funds and the number of eligible unique beneficiaries. [1]\n5. **Apply Debits**: If there are uninsured funds for the account holder, apply debits to the account. [1]\n6. **Record Uninsured and Insured Amounts**: Record the respective uninsured and insured amounts for each account. [1]\n7. **Repeat the Process**: Repeat the process for all accounts at the bank, including joint accounts, trust accounts, and other types of accounts. [1]\nThe goal of this process is to determine the deposit insurance coverage for each account holder and to ensure that the FDIC's deposit insurance fund is used efficiently and effectively to protect depositors in the event of a bank failure.

Determine the aggregate funds each grantor has across all revocable trust accounts at the CI allocated to eligible unique primary beneficiaries (Source [1], Step 4).\n2. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of an account holder is five or fewer or if all primary beneficiaries have equal interest in the grantor's trust account, then:\n   a) If the total amount of the grantor's interest does not exceed SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then all of the grantor's revocable trust funds at the CI are fully insured (Source [1], Step 5a).\n   b) If the total amount of the grantor's interest is greater than SMDIA times the number of eligible unique beneficiaries, then the excess is the uninsured amount for the account holder (Source [1], Step 5b).\n3. If the total number of eligible unique beneficiaries of a grantor is six or more and all the beneficiaries do not have equal interest in the trust, then:\n   a) Calculate the insured and uninsured amount for the funds associated with each beneficiary based on the aggregate dollar allocation from each grantor to each eligible unique beneficiary (Source [1], Step 6a).\n   b) If the total amount of the grantor exceeds the insured amount calculated based on the above, the excess is the uninsured amount for the grantor (Source [1], Step 6b).\n4. For all funds that do not meet the requirements for the REV ORC, aggregate and calculate deposit in the SGL ORC (Source [1], Step 7).\n5. If there are uninsured funds for the grantor in either the REV or other ORC, then apply debits (Source [1], Step 8).\n6. Record the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account (Source [1], Step 9).\n7. The insured amount of the grantor for each associated account is the difference between the grantor's interests in that account and the uninsured amount calculated based on the steps above (Source [1], Step 10).\n\nThe High-Level Process at Failure section is not explicitly described in the provided context. However, based on the provided information, it appears that the process involves:\n\n1. Identifying the accounts that do not meet the requirements for the REV ORC.\n2. Aggregating and calculating deposit in the SGL ORC for these accounts.\n3. Applying debits to the uninsured funds.\n4. Recording the respective uninsured amount of the grantor to each associated account.\n5. Calculating the insured amount for each individual account as the sum of the current balance and accrued interest, less the uninsured amount.\n\nNote that the provided context and sources do not explicitly describe the High-Level Process at Failure section, so the above information is based on the available information and may not be comprehensive.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] 370 — pages 20-21, 25",
