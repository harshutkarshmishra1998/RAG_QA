    "answer": "\n\nQUESTION 1:\nDescribe the full decision tree for classifying an account as Single vs Joint vs Trust.\n\nANSWER:\nHere is the full decision tree for classifying an account as Single vs Joint vs Trust: [1]\n**Step 1: Determine if the account is a Single Account** [1]\n- If the account meets the definition of a Single Account (refer to Section 4.1.2 of the document), then: [1]\n- Set DP_Right_Capacity equal to SGL. [1]\n- The account is classified as a Single Account. [1]\n**Step 2: Determine if the account is a Joint Account** [1]\n- If the account meets the definition of a \"qualifying\" joint account (refer to Section 4.1.3.2 of the document), then: [1]\n- Set DP_Right_Capacity equal to JNT. [1]\n- Split the total account balance and accrued interest equally across the total number of account co-owners. [1]\n- Each co-owner of a qualifying joint account is insured up to SMDIA for their share of all qualifying joint accounts at the same Cl. [1]\n- The account is classified as a Joint Account. [1]\n**Step 3: Determine if the account is a Trust Account** [1]\n- If the account meets the definition of a revocable trust account (refer to Section 4.1.4.1 of the document), then: [1]\n- Determine the number of eligible beneficiaries by counting the number of living primary beneficiaries (identified in the trust agreement or for informal trust in bank records). [1]\n- If a beneficiary is ineligible, then: [1]\n- Ignore the beneficiary for purposes of deposit insurance calculation. [1]\n- Treat the funds associated with that ineligible beneficiary as funds in a single account (SGL_ORC) for the grantor and aggregate with other SGL accounts the grantor has at the same Cl. [1]\n- If a primary beneficiary is invalid, then: [1]\n- Allocate the funds associated with that invalid beneficiary to the remaining beneficiaries. [1]\n- If the co-owners of a revocable trust are the sole beneficiaries of the corresponding trust, then: [1]\n- Identify the account as a joint account and the account shall be insured as a joint account (refer to Section 4.1.3). [1]\n- If the account names as beneficiary a formal revocable trust owned in whole or part by someone other than the account holders, then: [1]\n- Refer to Section 4.1.2 or Section 4.1.3 of the document for Single or Joint Accounts representing the interest of the grantor(s). [1]\n- If the account has no eligible beneficiaries, then: [1]\n- Refer to Section 4.1.2 or Section 4.1.3 of the document for Single or Joint Accounts depending on the grantor(s). [1]\n- Set DP_Right_Capacity equal to REV. [1]\n- Identify information related to allocation of funds to eligible unique primary beneficiaries. [1]\n- The account is classified as a Trust Account. [1]\n**Step 4: Determine if the account co-owner is deceased** [1]\n- If the account co-owner is deceased, then: [1]\n- Determine if the six-month rule applies (refer to Section 2.3.5 of the document). [1]\n- If the six-month rule applies, then: [1]\n- Continue to classify the account as JNT (subject to other JNT requirements). [1]\n- If the six-month rule does not apply, then: [1]\n- Recognize the account co-owner's death for purposes of ORC selection and insurance calculation. [1]\n- Reclassify the account as an SGL. [1]\n**Step 5: Determine if the account meets the signature card requirement** [1]\n- If the account does not meet the signature card requirement, then: [1]\n- Place the account in the Pending File under the JNT DP_Right_Capacity code and the RAC Pending Reason code. [1]\n**Step 6: Determine if the owners have equal withdrawal rights** [1]\n- If the owners do not have equal withdrawal rights, then: [1]\n- Determine the ORC by the actual ownership interest of the named account holders. [1]\n- Refer to Section 4.1.2 of the document for Single Accounts.

    "answer": "\n\nQUESTION 1:\nWhy does the FDIC aggregate balances by beneficial owner before applying insurance limits\n\nANSWER:\nThe FDIC aggregates balances by beneficial owner before applying insurance limits because it is necessary to determine the total amount of deposits held by each individual or entity. [1]\nThis is done to ensure that the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage limits are applied correctly. [1]\nWhen an account is identified as a single ownership account, the FDIC aggregates the total account balance and accrued interest by each unique beneficial owner for all deposits held by the owner in the single account right and capacity at the same CI (Control Institution). [1]\nThis means that if an individual has multiple single ownership accounts at the same CI, the FDIC will combine the balances of all those accounts to determine the total amount of deposits held by that individual. [1]\nSimilarly, when an account is identified as a joint account, the FDIC will determine if it meets the requirements for a qualifying joint account. [1]\nIf it does, the FDIC will treat the account as a joint account and apply the deposit insurance coverage limits accordingly. [1]\nIf it does not qualify as a joint account, the FDIC will treat the funds as jointly owned by the remaining natural person co-owners. [1]\nBy aggregating balances by beneficial owner, the FDIC can ensure that each individual or entity is treated fairly and that the deposit insurance coverage limits are applied correctly. [1]\nThis helps to prevent over-insurance or under-insurance of deposits, which could lead to unfair outcomes for depositors. [1]\nIn the case of revocable trusts, the FDIC will identify the grantor and unique primary beneficiaries, and determine the allocations to the eligible unique primary beneficiaries based on the information of the allocation of funds. [1]\nThe FDIC will then treat each unique combination of grantor and eligible unique primary beneficiary as a separate beneficial owner, and aggregate the total account balance and accrued interest for each of these beneficial owners.

[1]\nWhen a joint account does not meet the FDIC's requirements for a qualifying joint account, it is reclassified as a single account owned by the remaining natural person co-owners.

        "question": "Why does the FDIC aggregate balances by beneficial owner before applying insurance limits",
        "answer": "The FDIC aggregates balances by beneficial owner before applying insurance limits because it is necessary to determine the total amount of deposits held by each individual or entity. [1]\nThis is done to ensure that the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage limits are applied correctly. [1]\nWhen an account is identified as a single ownership account, the FDIC aggregates the total account balance and accrued interest by each unique beneficial owner for all deposits held by the owner in the single account right and capacity at the same CI (Control Institution). [1]\nThis means that if an individual has multiple single ownership accounts at the same CI, the FDIC will combine the balances of all those accounts to determine the total amount of deposits held by that individual. [1]\nSimilarly, when an account is identified as a joint account, the FDIC will determine if it meets the requirements for a qualifying joint account. [1]\nIf it does, the FDIC will treat the account as a joint account and apply the deposit insurance coverage limits accordingly. [1]\nIf it does not qualify as a joint account, the FDIC will treat the funds as jointly owned by the remaining natural person co-owners. [1]\nBy aggregating balances by beneficial owner, the FDIC can ensure that each individual or entity is treated fairly and that the deposit insurance coverage limits are applied correctly.

    "answer": "\n\nQUESTION 1:\nWhy does the FDIC aggregate balances by beneficial owner before applying insurance limits\n\nANSWER:\nThe FDIC aggregates balances by beneficial owner before applying insurance limits because it is required by the FDIC's regulations, specifically 12 CFR § 330.9(c) [1]. This regulation states that credit balances on debt accounts constitute deposit liabilities and should be insured in the JNT ORC if the obligors are jointly liable [1]. Additionally, the FDIC's Part 370 Recordkeeping Information Technology Functional Guide Version 3.0 states that the account holder of a single account for the combined amount of his or her interests in all single accounts at the same CI is entitled to SMDIA, and that the FDIC aggregates total account balance and accrued interest by each unique beneficial owner for all deposits held by the owner in the single account right and capacity at the CI [1].\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] 20260213_215811_New_FDIC_-_Information_Technology_Functional_Guide_for_Part_370 — pages 2, 5",
