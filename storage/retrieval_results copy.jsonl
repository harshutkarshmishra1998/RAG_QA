Alternative beneficiaries that depend on the death of primary beneficiaries are not taken into\naccount in calculating deposit insurance coverage, if the primary beneficiaries are alive.\n8 Deposits of an irrevocable trust continue to be insured under the trust account category even following the death of a \ngrantor. See 87 Fed. Reg. 4455, 4465 (Jan. 28, 2022) (\u201cThe merger of the categories also would eliminate the need for current \n\u00a7 330.10(h) and (i), which allows for the continued application of the revocable trust rules to the account of a revocable trust\nthat becomes irrevocable due to the death of the trust\u2019s owner.\u201d).\nFDIC \u2013 Part 370 Recordkeeping \nInformation Technology Functional Guide \nVersion 3.0\nPage | 25\n2) If a grantor is deceased determine if the FDIC\u2019s six-month rule applies. See 2.3.5. If it does, then continue to \nclassify the account as TST. If the six-month rule does not apply, then recognize the grantor\u2019s death for \npurposes of ORC selection and insurance calculation. Under the TST ORC:\na) If the TST is an informal trust (e.g. POD account) with two grantors, then after the first grantor dies and \nthe six-month rule expires, treat the account as a TST with one grantor.\nb) If the TST is a formal trust with two grantors, then after the first grantor dies and the six-month rule \nexpires, treat the account as a TST with one grantor.\n3) Identify eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\na) If all primary beneficiaries are deceased, then:\ni)  If there are no substitute beneficiaries named in the trust document for that primary beneficiary,  then\n(1) Funds associated with that trust account should be treated as funds in a single or joint account \nORC belonging to the trust grantor(s) and aggregated and insured with other accounts of the \ntrust grantor(s) in the corresponding ORC.\nii) If the trust document (or bank records for an informal trust account) indicates the interest associated \nwith a deceased primary beneficiary is passed to other beneficiaries (e.g., per stirpes9 or per capita), \ndetermine the eligibility of the successor beneficiaries and the total number of unique eligible \nbeneficiaries (including eligible successor beneficiaries) for purposes of deposit insurance calculation.\nb) If some primary beneficiaries are deceased and there is no contingency for the deceased beneficiaries,\nthen determine the number of eligible beneficiaries by counting the number of living primary \nbeneficiaries (identified in the trust agreement or, for informal trust, in bank records). For example, if a \nPOD account identifies three primary beneficiaries but one dies (without contingent beneficiaries), then \nthe trust has two eligible beneficiaries.\nc) If a beneficiary is ineligible,10 then the beneficiary should be ignored for purposes of deposit insurance \ncalculation under TST.", "metadata": {}, "rrf_score": 0.031498, "source_queries": ["What are the key steps that occur following a covered institution's failure under Part 370?", "What process steps occur after a covered institution fails under Part 370?"]}, {"chunk_id": 31, "text": "f)\nIf the account has no eligible beneficiaries listed, then refer to Section 4.1.2 or Section 4.1.3 of this\ndocument for Single or Joint Accounts depending on the grantor(s).\n4)\nIf the account meets the definition of a trust account, then set DP_Right_Capacity equal to TST.\n5)\nIf grantor information or beneficiary information is not complete, then place the account in the Pending File\n(see Section 5.4 of this document).\n6)\nEach unique combination of grantor and eligible unique primary beneficiary is entitled to the SMDIA for each\ngrantor-beneficiary relationship across all deposit accounts eligible for insurance coverage under 12 CFR \u00a7\n330.10, with the maximum total insured amounts of $1,250,000.11\n4.1.4.4 Trust Account Deposit Insurance Calculation Effective on and After April 1, 2024\nIf all trust accounts have been processed through Section 4.1.4.3 Right and Capacity and SMDIA Calculation or \nplaced in the Pending File (see Section 5.4 of this document), then complete the following steps in order:\n1)\nIdentify the grantor and unique primary beneficiaries.\n2)\nFor each grantor identify the associated eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\n3)\nDetermine the aggregate funds each grantor has across all trust accounts at the CI eligible for insurance\ncoverage under 12 CFR \u00a7 330.10.
