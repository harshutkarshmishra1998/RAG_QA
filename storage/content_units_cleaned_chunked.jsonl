One way to\nidentify the applicable ORC would be based on account titling. For reference purposes only, the following\nresources list the i) key words, and ii) the business rules that the FDIC has used for bank failures.\n\ne FDIC's IT System Insurance Determination Rules\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/recordkeeping/documents/it-system-insurancedetermination-rules.pdf.\n\ne FDIC’s Ownership Rights and Capacity Category Key Words\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/recordkeeping/documents/ownership-right-capacity-\n\nkey-words.pdf.\n\nAfter the initial ORC assignments are made, Cl staff may validate the assignments by cross-checking with service\ncharge codes for business accounts and codes for public institution accounts, among other methods.\n\n4.1.2 Single Accounts\n\n4.1.2.1 Right and Capacity and SMDIA Calculation\n\nDetermine if an account meets FDIC requirements for a single account:\n\n1) Identify the account holder.?\n\n2) If there are multiple account holders, refer to section 4.1.3 of this document for Joint Accounts.\n\n3) If the account is titled in the name of a trust, then refer to Section 4.1.4 or Section 4.1.5 of this document for\ntrust accounts.\n\n4) If the account is titled in an individual’s name and bank records indicate the account is payable on death to\neligible beneficiaries, then refer to Section 4.1.4 of this document for trust accounts.\n\n5) If the account is a self-directed retirement plan account, then refer to Section 4.1.6 of this document for\nCertain Retirement Accounts.\n\n6) The SGL category may include: (1) single owner, non-retirement, non-trust deposits, e.g., personal checking,\nsavings, etc.; (2) single owner “doing business as” deposits; (3) accounts established for the “estate of” a\ndeceased party;? (4) tax and insurance payments under (MSA), assuming the payment was from one person\n(not two people); (5) deposits styled as trusts but ineligible for coverage under the trust categories‘; and (6)\n\n2 Account holder shall be deemed as a depositor entitled to up to the SMDIA as provided for under the applicable ownership\ncategory.\n\n3 A deceased account holder may have multiple accounts at the bank in the single account ownership right and capacity\ncategory (SGL ORC). Accounts titled to the decedent or for the “estate of” the decedent, in the SGL category, should be\naggregated and insured up to the SMDIA.\n\n4 Part 370 recordkeeping and reporting should utilize ownership right and capacity codes “REV” and “IRR” for trust accounts\ninsured as described in §§ 330.10 and 330.13 until March 31, 2024. On and after April 1, 2024, Part 370 recordkeeping and\nreporting should utilize ownership right and capacity code “TST” for the combined revocable and irrevocable trust category set\nforth in the revision of § 330.10 that takes effect on April 1, 2024.\n\nPage | 19", "token_count": 806}

Alternative or contingent beneficiaries that depend on the death of primary beneficiaries are not\ntaken into account in calculating deposit insurance coverage, if the primary beneficiaries are alive, except\nin the case where a life estate beneficiary is identified. Some trusts identify a life estate beneficiary with\nremainder beneficiaries upon the death of the life estate beneficiary. For deposit insurance calculations,\neach grantor — life estate beneficiary pair is insured up to the SMDIA across all REV trusts at the same Cl.\nThe remainder beneficiaries are also considered primary beneficiaries.\n\nIf a grantor is deceased determine if the FDIC’s six-month rule applies. See 2.3.5. If it does, then continue to\nclassify the account as REV. If the six-month rule does not apply, then recognize the grantor’s death for\npurposes of ORC selection and insurance calculation. Under the REV ORC:\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nIf the REV is an informal revocable trust (e.g. POD account) with two grantors, then after the first grantor\ndies and the six-month rule expires, treat the account as a REV with one grantor.\n\nIf the REV is a formal revocable trust with two grantors, then after the first grantor dies and the six month\nrule expires, treat the account as a REV with one grantor (unless the terms of the trust agreement dictate\nthe trust be treated as an IRR).\n\nIdentify eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nIf all primary beneficiaries are deceased, then:\n\ni) If there are no substitute or contingent beneficiaries named in the revocable trust document for that\nprimary beneficiary, then\n\n(1) Funds associated with that revocable trust should be treated as funds in a single or joint account\nORC belonging to the trust grantor(s) and aggregated and insured with other accounts of the\ntrust grantor(s) in the corresponding ORC.\n\nii) If the trust document (or bank records for an informal revocable trust) indicates the interest\nassociated with a deceased primary beneficiary is passed to other beneficiaries (e.g., per stirpes® or\nper capita), determine the eligibility of the successor beneficiaries and the total number of unique\neligible beneficiaries (including eligible successor beneficiaries) for purposes of deposit insurance\ncalculation.\n\nIf some primary beneficiaries are deceased and there is no contingency for the deceased beneficiaries,\nthen determine the number of eligible beneficiaries by counting the number of living primary\nbeneficiaries (identified in the trust agreement or, for informal trust, in bank records). For example, if a\nPOD account identifies three primary beneficiaries but one dies (without contingent beneficiaries), then\nthe trust has two eligible beneficiaries.\n\nFor payable-on death (“POD”) and formal revocable trust account.\n\ni) Ifa beneficiary is ineligible, ® then the beneficiary should be ignored for purposes of deposit insurance\ncalculation under REV.\n\n(1) Funds associated with that ineligible beneficiary should be treated as funds in a single account\n(SGL_ORC) for the grantor and aggregated with other SGL accounts the grantor has at the same\nCl. For example, if A and B co-own a POD revocable, name a corporation as the beneficiary, and\nhave $300,000 on deposit, then half the account ($150,000) is treated as A’s SGL ORC and the\n\n5 Per stirpes implies the estate of the deceased primary beneficiary is to be distributed to each branch of the family in equal share.\n6 An ineligible beneficiary does not meet the requirements of an eligible beneficiary but is still able to legally receive the bequest\nunder state law.
