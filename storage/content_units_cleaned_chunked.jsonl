Under Part 370, the CI is required to maintain complete \nand accurate depositor information and to configure its IT systems to calculate the amount of deposit insurance \ncoverage available for each deposit account in the event of the CI’s failure. After the CI’s failure, the FDIC would be \nappointed receiver and would use the CI’s records and IT systems to facilitate the deposit insurance \ndetermination.\n2.1 \nBackground\nIn November 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule requiring large Insured Depository Institutions (“IDIs”) with two \nmillion or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate information needed by the FDIC to determine \ndeposit insurance coverage for each deposit account, except as otherwise provided. Each CI must also configure \nits IT systems to be capable of calculating the insured and uninsured amounts in each deposit account by \nownership right and capacity, which would be used by the FDIC to make deposit insurance determinations in the \nevent of the CI’s failure.\nPlease refer to the final rule at 81 FR 87734 (December 5, 2016) and the supplementary information contained \ntherein for more information.\n2.2 \nKey Concepts\n2.2.1 \nDeposit insurance coverage has increased over time", "token_count": 673}

As the economy and banking industry evolved, Congress and the FDIC recognized \nthe need for additional coverage. Consequently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and relevant regulations have \nbeen amended to both increase the SMDIA and provide for additional coverage through the creation of different \nownership rights and capacities. Congress most recently raised the SMDIA to $250,000 in 2010.\n2.2.2 \nPrompt access to insured deposits is essential\nConfidence in the FDIC is critical to the public’s confidence in the banking system. No depositor has lost a single \npenny of insured deposits since the FDIC was established in 1933. Of equal importance, the FDIC is required to \nmake funds available to depositors as soon as possible, often by the next business day after an IDI fails.\n2.2.3 \nDepositors are insured separately at each IDI\nWhile each depositor’s insurance coverage is limited to the SMDIA for each ORC, each depositor is insured \nseparately at each IDI. A depositor’s coverage in a category at one IDI does not affect the depositor’s coverage in \nthat same insurance category for an account at a different IDI.\n2.2.4 \nFDIC relies on the CI’s deposit account records\nIn the event of the failure of a CI, the FDIC relies upon the deposit account records of the CI to determine the \nownership of deposits and thereby the amount of the deposit insurance coverage available to each depositor. If \nthe records are complete, clear, and unambiguous, then those records shall be considered binding on the \ndepositor, and the FDIC shall consider no other records on how the deposits are owned.\n2.2.5 \nDepositors are insured in different ownership “rights and capacities”\nDeposit insurance coverage is provided for deposits held in the different ORCs. All deposits with an IDI, whether \nheld in one account or multiple accounts, are aggregated and insured up to the SMDIA for each ORC.\nFDIC – Part 370 Recordkeeping \nInformation Technology Functional Guide \nVersion 3.0\nPage | 8\n2.2.6 \nFiduciary and agency accounts may receive pass-through coverage\nDeposits in fiduciary or agency accounts may be entitled to pass-through deposit insurance coverage. These \naccounts, described more fully at 12 CFR § 330.5, are established and maintained by third parties on behalf of the \nbeneficial owner of the deposit. For deposit insurance calculation purposes, these pass-through deposits would be \naggregated with all other deposits held in the same ORC by the beneficial owner.\n2.2.7 \nDeposits eligible for FDIC deposit insurance\nDeposit insurance coverage is available for domestic deposits only. Non-deposit accounts, such as securities \naccounts, and deposits at foreign branches are excluded from coverage.

A joint deposit account shall be deemed to be a qualifying joint account only if: \n(i) All co-owners of the funds in the account are “natural persons” (as defined in 12 CFR § 330.1(l)); and\n(ii) Each co-owner has personally signed, which may include signing electronically, a deposit account signature\ncard, or the alternative method provided in the paragraph below; and\n(iii) Each co-owner possesses withdrawal rights on the same basis.\nThe second requirement listed above is known as the signature card requirement. This requirement does not \napply to certificates of deposit, negotiable instruments, and agency accounts. The signature card requirement \nserves as an indicator of ownership of the funds, which is the basis for FDIC deposit insurance coverage. The \nsignature card requirement helps to differentiate accounts where multiple signors exist, and those signors are not \nowners of the funds, such as a “power of attorney” arrangement (sometimes referred to as a “convenience \naccount.”)\nThe 2019 amendments to 12 CFR § 330.9(c) provide flexibility for institutions to meet the signature card \nrequirements through information in the institution’s deposit account records establishing co-ownership of the \naccount, such as evidence that the institution has issued a mechanism for accessing the account to each co-owner \nor evidence of usage of the deposit account by each co-owner. As an example, the requirement could be satisfied \nby evidence that an IDI has issued a debit card to each co-owner of the account or evidence that each co-owner \nof the account has transacted using the deposit account. These amendments do not attempt to specify all of the \nforms of evidence of co-ownership that could be used to satisfy the signature card requirement.\nCredit balances on debt accounts constitute deposit liabilities. If a covered institution’s debt account records \ndemonstrate that the obligors are jointly liable and otherwise meet the requirements for qualifying joint accounts \nunder 12 CFR § 330.9(c), then the credit balance should be insured in the JNT ORC. FDIC will view execution of the \ndebt agreement by each person with joint liability as satisfaction of the joint account signature card requirement.\nWhere a covered institution believes accounts would qualify under the JNT ORC but where the accounts require \nadditional review or remediation, those accounts can be placed in the Pending File with the JNT ORC designation\nFDIC – Part 370 Recordkeeping \nInformation Technology Functional Guide \nVersion 3.0\nPage | 9\nand a pending code of RAC, in conjunction with an approved relief request. Where a covered institution believes \nan account does not meet the JNT ORC requirements, then that account should revert to the SGL ORC with the \nfunds apportioned evenly among the named owners.\n2.3.2 \nData Completeness", "token_count": 785}

This process has historically supported the timely payment of\ndeposit insurance by the FDIC following bank failures. An addendum to the Deposit Broker’s Processing Guide\n(Appendix D hereto) provides an alternative to the existing process that may be used in connection with the\nfailure of a CI. Appendix D includes additional fields that will improve integration with the CI’s IT systems as\nwell as updated processes that can be used to transmit information on the beneficial owner(s) of deposits\ndirectly to the CI’s systems in the event of failure. Under the approach described in Appendix D, the CI’s IT\nsystem must be capable of receiving multiple and sequential submissions of depositor data from account\nholders and completing iterative deposit insurance calculations as more information becomes available.\nBecause the CI’s IT systems will be used in making deposit insurance calculations, the use of the processes\noutlined in Appendix D may enable the payment of deposit insurance to the beneficial owners of deposits in a\nmore expedient manner. For this reason, FDIC staff recommends that CIs work with account holders that\nmaintain deposit accounts on behalf of other persons to develop a process to intake the necessary data in the\nfile format described in Appendix D.\nShould the CI fail, account holders of deposit accounts entitled to pass-through deposit insurance coverage\nmay continue to submit, to the FDIC, depositor information using the existing file format and process defined\nin the current Deposit Broker’s Processing Guide. This may result in a lengthier deposit insurance\ndetermination time for these accounts due to the manual nature of the processing described therein, which\nmay not be sufficient to meet the requirements of Part 370 regarding accounts with transactional features.\nAlternatively, use the file format and processes described in Appendix D, the account holder will use the file\nto:\na.\nCorrectly assign and record (in advance) the appropriate ORC for each beneficial interest in the\naccount(s) held at the CI;\nb.\nIdentify all sub-accounts that have transactional features as described in 12 CFR § 370.2;", "token_count": 678}

At failure, however, the initial aggregation discussed herein allows immediate \nliquidity for depositors with low-dollar accounts and alleviates system processing time. When the broker and \nother third-party files are received, all deposit accounts will be aggregated by ORC. The FDIC will use the CI’s \nIT system to calculate deposit insurance as follows.\n• \nInitial Aggregation by Depositor: The first aggregation is done by the CI at the depositor level. If the \ndepositor’s aggregate balance at a CI is no more than the SMDIA, then all the funds the account \nholder has at a CI are fully insured and do not require aggregation by ownership right and capacity. \nHowever, as iterative processing of accounts occurs past the initial aggregation, all accounts should \nbe aggregated on an iterative basis to ensure there is no overpayment of insurance and to identify \naccounts by ownership right and capacity that might increase above SMDIA as new account \ninformation comes in.\n• \nAggregation by Ownership Right & Capacity: The second step of aggregation is at the ORC level. If a \ndepositor’s aggregate balances exceed the SMDIA, the balances must be aggregated by ORC for a \ndeposit insurance determination, as required by law.\n• \nCalculate Insurance: Calculate insurance as outlined in Section 4 of this Guide.\n• \nRelease funds up to the SMDIA: Insured funds will be released iteratively as the insurance \ndeterminations are completed. The hold on the estimated uninsured amount will remain, i.e., a \npartial hold, until all pending files are processed. Allocate insured and uninsured balances among \nbeneficial owners as outlined in Section 4.1.16 of this Guide.\nStep 5: Generate Output Files and Reports\nMajor Activity: Generate Output Files that will serve as the permanent record of the insurance determination \nfor the depositors at the time of closing, including accounts in a pending status.\nKey Inputs  Key Outputs", "token_count": 800}

FDIC has developed an order of allocating uninsured funds when debiting the uninsured funds \nto reduce the burden and disruption of pending transactions to depositors that might have accounts that need \nadjustment based on the Allocation of Uninsured Funds. This is generally the same for most ownership categories, \nexcept jointly owned and trust accounts, discussed in detail below. Under this practice, the uninsured amount is \napplied based on the account product type in the following order of allocation: CDS, SAV, MMA, NOW, and DDA. \nThe rationale for this order is based on time and savings accounts historically having the fewest pending \ntransactions as opposed to demand deposit accounts being used regularly for day-to-day funding needs. \nIf an account is joint and not titled to a trust, uninsured amounts are debited on a pro-rata basis based on the coowner’s share percentage regardless of the account product type. The pro rata uninsured application is used for \njoint accounts to ensure a fully insured joint owner is not disproportionately affected.", "token_count": 727}

A CI’s IT system must have the capability to prepare and maintain the files detailed below. These files \nmust be prepared in successive iterations as the FDIC receives additional data from external sources necessary to \ncomplete the deposit insurance determinations, and, as it updates pending determinations. The files will be \ncomprised of the following four tables. The unique identifier and government identification are required in all four \ntables to link the depositor information and the broker information respectively. If a null value is allowed in a field, \nthe record should not be placed in the Pending File. \n \nA null value, as indicated in the table below, is allowed for fields that are not immediately needed to calculate deposit \ninsurance. To ensure timely calculations for depositor liquidity purposes, the information with null-value designations \ncan be obtained after the initial deposit insurance calculation. As due diligence for recordkeeping progresses \nthroughout the years of ongoing compliance, the FDIC expects that the banks will continue efforts to capture the nullvalue designations and populate the output file to alleviate the burden at the time of bank failure.\nCustomer File", "token_count": 786}

Under Part 370, each covered institution must configure its IT system to be capable of accurately calculating the deposit \ninsurance available for each deposit account in accordance with the FDIC’s deposit insurance rules set forth in 12 CFR part 330 (“Part \n330”), should the CI fail. In the event of the CI’s failure, the FDIC would use the CI’s IT system to calculate the amount of deposit \ninsurance available and debit the uninsured amount from each deposit account (collectively, the “deposit insurance \ndetermination”).\nPart 370 recognizes that an insured depository institution may not be required to maintain all of the information needed by the FDIC \nto calculate the entire amount of deposit insurance available to each depositor with respect to certain types of deposit accounts \nunder the existing regulatory framework. For that reason, CIs are permitted, under Section 370.4(b) (“alternative recordkeeping \nrequirements”), to maintain less information in their deposit account records for certain types of deposit accounts than otherwise \nrequired under Part 370. To meet the alternative recordkeeping requirements, the CI must maintain in its deposit account records \ncertain information that will facilitate the FDIC’s prompt collection of the additional information needed to calculate the full amount \nof deposit insurance available for those deposit accounts after the CI’s failure. These alternative recordkeeping requirements apply \nto, among other things, certain deposit accounts that would be insured on a ‘‘pass-through’’ basis (such as brokered deposits), \nbecause beneficial ownership information is not required to be maintained by the covered institution, and to certain deposit \naccounts for which the amount of insurance is dependent on additional facts (such as deposit accounts held in connection with a \ntrust).\nThe protocol described in this addendum, or an alternative approach, capable of supporting this deposit insurance calculation within \ntwenty-four (24) hours following failure must be in place. Compliance with the recommended practices and standards set forth in \nthis Addendum is voluntary and noncompliance therewith will not, in itself, result in enforcement action.\nDeposit Broker’s Processing Guide", "token_count": 738}

This DPBG supplies a file format and process for submitting the information and \nsupporting documentation necessary for the FDIC to receive and process the information from brokers to properly perform its \nresponsibilities to make insured funds available to depositors in a timely manner. This process includes a number of manual \nprocesses and forms (declarations and an affidavit). The same process may also be used to collect information from account holders \nother than deposit brokers whose deposits are eligible for pass-through deposit insurance coverage.

The file format and processes described in the \nAddendum can be utilized to process the full spectrum of accounts that qualify for alternative recordkeeping as described by 12 CFR § 370.4(b), \nincluding brokered deposits and other deposit accounts for which the amount of insurance is dependent on additional facts which must be \nobtained from the account holder (such as deposit accounts held in connection with a trust). The following pages use an example set of deposits to \nillustrate the Part 370 Output Files generated by a CI’s system in various post-failure time periods.\nFDIC – Part 370 \nInformation Technology Functional Guide Version 3.0\nPage | 75\nTime Period 1 - Post Failure, Prior to Receiving Alternative Recordkeeping Entity Data, and After CI Runs Insurance Determination Engine\nBackground \nAt the beginning of Time Period 1, the CI failed. Although it has not yet received the necessary account details to make a complete insurance \ndetermination for its Alternative Recordkeeping Entity (ARE) depositors, the CI’s system processes all of its deposit accounts through its \ninsurance determination “engine” and generates an initial set of Part 370 Output Files. At the end of this Time Period, the CI’s system will have \ngenerated a Pending output file record for each ARE deposit account balance for which it does not have sufficient information to make an \ninsurance calculation. \n \n> The example below includes the processing of: \n A. One CD account from Anytown Broker, \n B. Marci Jones’s three single accounts, and \n C. Two business accounts of XYZ Corporation. \n \nWhen the CI fails, the total current balance of the above six accounts is $2,520,000. For simplicity, the example assumes there is no accrued \ninterest at the time of failure.", "token_count": 755}

Where sufficient account \ninformation has been received to enable it to do so, the CI’s system will make deposit insurance determinations for those pass-through accounts. \nThe CI’s system will then generate updated Part 370 Customer, Account, and Account Participant output files which incorporate the additional \ninsurance determinations. If an ARE has still not provided all the information necessary for a complete insurance determination on its deposit, \nthe CI’s system will also generate a Pending output file record representing the balance of the ARE’s deposit for which an insurance \ndetermination cannot yet be made.\n> In this example, Anytown Broker provides sufficient information for an insurance determination on its Government and Trust accounts.\nCustomer Output File (Time Period 5) \nAs with previous iterations, the Customer output file in Time Period 5 contains one record for each unique depositor known to the CI. When it \nreceives additional account owner information from AREs, the CI’s system will compare the account owner information received from the ARE to \ndetermine if any additional account owners have been identified. If so, the CI’s system will generate new Customer output file records as \nnecessary, assigning a “CS_Unique_ID” (e.g., the account owner’s Tax ID number) for each additional unique account owner identified.\n> In this example, no \"new\" customers have been reported in the additional ARE submission file(s) received, so the Customer output file does not\nchange.\nFigure 5.1 Customer Output File (Time Period 5)\nCS_Unique_ID\nCS_Govt_ID\nCS_Govt_ID_Type\nCS_Type\nCS_First_Name\nCS_Middle\n_Name\nCS_Last_Name\nCS_Name\n_Suffix\nCS_Entity_Name\nCS_Street_Add_Ln1\nCS_Street_\nAdd_Ln2\nCS_Street_\nAdd_Ln3\n(No Change) A. --> 6578658\n987654321\nTIN\nBUS\nAnytown Broker 123 Main St\n(No Change) B. --> 1278658\n122333444\nSSN\nIND\nMarci\nJones\n3434 Virginia Ave\n(No Change) C. --> 6489649\n981234567\nTIN\nBUS\nXYZ Corporation 100 Dredging Rd\n(No Change) D. --> 661234567\n661234567\nTIN\nGOV\nAnywhere City\n100 City Ave", "token_count": 795}

Under Part 370, the Cl is required to maintain complete\nand accurate depositor information and to configure its IT systems to calculate the amount of deposit insurance\ncoverage available for each deposit account in the event of the Cl’s failure. After the Cl’s failure, the FDIC would be\nappointed receiver and would use the Cl’s records and IT systems to facilitate the deposit insurance\ndetermination.\n\n2.1 Background\n\nIn November 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule requiring large Insured Depository Institutions (“IDIs”) with two\nmillion or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate information needed by the FDIC to determine\ndeposit insurance coverage for each deposit account, except as otherwise provided. Each Cl must also configure\nits IT systems to be capable of calculating the insured and uninsured amounts in each deposit account by\nownership right and capacity, which would be used by the FDIC to make deposit insurance determinations in the\nevent of the Cl’s failure.\n\nPlease refer to the final rule at 81 FR 87734 (December 5, 2016) and the supplementary information contained\ntherein for more information.\n\n2.2 Key Concepts\n\n2.2.1 Deposit insurance coverage has increased over time\n\nDeposit insurance was established through the Banking Act of 1933 with a standard maximum deposit insurance\namount (“SMDIA”) of $2,500. As the economy and banking industry evolved, Congress and the FDIC recognized\nthe need for additional coverage. Consequently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and relevant regulations have\nbeen amended to both increase the SMDIA and provide for additional coverage through the creation of different\nownership rights and capacities. Congress most recently raised the SMDIA to $250,000 in 2010.\n\n2.2.2 Prompt access to insured deposits is essential\n\nConfidence in the FDIC is critical to the public’s confidence in the banking system. No depositor has lost a single\npenny of insured deposits since the FDIC was established in 1933. Of equal importance, the FDIC is required to\nmake funds available to depositors as soon as possible, often by the next business day after an IDI fails.\n\n2.2.3. Depositors are insured separately at each IDI\n\nWhile each depositor’s insurance coverage is limited to the SMDIA for each ORC, each depositor is insured\nseparately at each IDI. A depositor’s coverage in a category at one IDI does not affect the depositor’s coverage in\nthat same insurance category for an account at a different IDI.\n\n2.2.4 FDIC relies on the Cl’s deposit account records\n\nIn the event of the failure of a Cl, the FDIC relies upon the deposit account records of the Cl to determine the\nownership of deposits and thereby the amount of the deposit insurance coverage available to each depositor. If\nthe records are complete, clear, and unambiguous, then those records shall be considered binding on the\ndepositor, and the FDIC shall consider no other records on how the deposits are owned.\n\n2.2.5 Depositors are insured in different ownership “rights and capacities”\n\nDeposit insurance coverage is provided for deposits held in the different ORCs. All deposits with an IDI, whether\nheld in one account or multiple accounts, are aggregated and insured up to the SMDIA for each ORC.\n\nPage | 7", "token_count": 879}

These\naccounts, described more fully at 12 CFR § 330.5, are established and maintained by third parties on behalf of the\nbeneficial owner of the deposit. For deposit insurance calculation purposes, these pass-through deposits would be\naggregated with all other deposits held in the same ORC by the beneficial owner.\n\n2.2.7. Deposits eligible for FDIC deposit insurance\n\nDeposit insurance coverage is available for domestic deposits only. Non-deposit accounts, such as securities\naccounts, and deposits at foreign branches are excluded from coverage. Deposit accounts with negative balances\n(overdraft) are also excluded because they are not deposit liabilities. Therefore, these accounts need not be\nincluded in the deposit insurance calculation.\n\n2.3 Recordkeeping\n2.3.1 Deposit Account Information\n\nThis section outlines the items for consideration when addressing the recordkeeping components necessary for\nthe deposit insurance calculation.\n\nJoint Accounts\n\nIn issuing Part 370, the FDIC did not change the rules that govern deposit insurance coverage, including the rule\npertaining to coverage for joint accounts, found at 12 CFR § 330.9.\n\nSection 330.9 sets forth requirements that must be satisfied for a joint account to be insured under the joint\naccount category. A joint deposit account shall be deemed to be a qualifying joint account only if:\n\n(i) All co-owners of the funds in the account are “natural persons” (as defined in 12 CFR § 330.1(/)); and\n\n(ii) Each co-owner has personally signed, which may include signing electronically, a deposit account signature\ncard, or the alternative method provided in the paragraph below; and\n\n(iii) Each co-owner possesses withdrawal rights on the same basis.\n\nThe second requirement listed above is known as the signature card requirement. This requirement does not\napply to certificates of deposit, negotiable instruments, and agency accounts. The signature card requirement\nserves as an indicator of ownership of the funds, which is the basis for FDIC deposit insurance coverage. The\nsignature card requirement helps to differentiate accounts where multiple signors exist, and those signors are not\nowners of the funds, such as a “power of attorney” arrangement (sometimes referred to as a “convenience\naccount.”)\n\nThe 2019 amendments to 12 CFR § 330.9(c) provide flexibility for institutions to meet the signature card\nrequirements through information in the institution’s deposit account records establishing co-ownership of the\naccount, such as evidence that the institution has issued a mechanism for accessing the account to each co-owner\nor evidence of usage of the deposit account by each co-owner. As an example, the requirement could be satisfied\nby evidence that an IDI has issued a debit card to each co-owner of the account or evidence that each co-owner\nof the account has transacted using the deposit account. These amendments do not attempt to specify all of the\nforms of evidence of co-ownership that could be used to satisfy the signature card requirement.\n\nCredit balances on debt accounts constitute deposit liabilities. If a covered institution’s debt account records\ndemonstrate that the obligors are jointly liable and otherwise meet the requirements for qualifying joint accounts\nunder 12 CFR § 330.9(c), then the credit balance should be insured in the JNT ORC. FDIC will view execution of the\ndebt agreement by each person with joint liability as satisfaction of the joint account signature card requirement.\n\nWhere a covered institution believes accounts would qualify under the JNT ORC but where the accounts require\nadditional review or remediation, those accounts can be placed in the Pending File with the JNT ORC designation\n\nPage | 8", "token_count": 994}

This process has historically supported the timely payment of\ndeposit insurance by the FDIC following bank failures. An addendum to the Deposit Broker’s Processing Guide\n(Appendix D hereto) provides an alternative to the existing process that may be used in connection with the\nfailure of a Cl. Appendix D includes additional fields that will improve integration with the Cl’s IT systems as\nwell as updated processes that can be used to transmit information on the beneficial owner(s) of deposits\ndirectly to the Cl’s systems in the event of failure. Under the approach described in Appendix D, the Cl’s IT\nsystem must be capable of receiving multiple and sequential submissions of depositor data from account\nholders and completing iterative deposit insurance calculations as more information becomes available.\nBecause the Cl’s IT systems will be used in making deposit insurance calculations, the use of the processes\noutlined in Appendix D may enable the payment of deposit insurance to the beneficial owners of deposits in a\nmore expedient manner. For this reason, FDIC staff recommends that Cls work with account holders that\nmaintain deposit accounts on behalf of other persons to develop a process to intake the necessary data in the\nfile format described in Appendix D.\n\nShould the Cl fail, account holders of deposit accounts entitled to pass-through deposit insurance coverage\nmay continue to submit, to the FDIC, depositor information using the existing file format and process defined\nin the current Deposit Broker’s Processing Guide. This may result in a lengthier deposit insurance\ndetermination time for these accounts due to the manual nature of the processing described therein, which\nmay not be sufficient to meet the requirements of Part 370 regarding accounts with transactional features.\nAlternatively, use the file format and processes described in Appendix D, the account holder will use the file\nto:\n\na. Correctly assign and record (in advance) the appropriate ORC for each beneficial interest in the\naccount(s) held at the Cl;\n\nb. Identify all sub-accounts that have transactional features as described in 12 CFR § 370.2;\n\nc. Submit one file containing twenty-nine (29) fields including the nineteen (19) fields from the\nexisting Deposit Broker’s Processing Guide and the ten (10) additional fields in a pipe-delimited\nASCII file as described in the Addendum. Alternative recordkeeping data for all sub-accounts\nwith transactional features must be provided to the FDIC within twenty-four (24) hours of the\nFDIC’s appointment as receiver. The Cl’s IT system must be capable of receiving multiple and\nsequential submissions of depositor data from account holders and complete iterative deposit\ninsurance calculations as more information becomes available.\n\n2.3.6.2 Alternative Recordkeeping Entity Report\n\nThe Cl’s IT system could be capable of creating a derivative report, the “Alternative Recordkeeping Entity Report,”\nsummarizing certain information from Part 370 output files for accounts maintained in accordance with the\nalternative recordkeeping requirements as provided in section 370.4(b). This report will be used to timely notify\nthe pass-through account holders and record the status of payments to beneficial owners. This Alternative\nRecordkeeping Entity Report is not required under Part 370. The creation of this report is voluntary and\nnoncompliance will not, in itself, result in any enforcement action. The Alternative Recordkeeping Entity Report\nwould contain the following information:\n\ne Account holder name\ne = Point of contact\ne Email address\n\nPage | 11", "token_count": 1044}

This calculation process is\npredicated on certain fundamental processes that all Cls are currently capable of executing. These processes\ninclude timely end-of-day processing, accurate calculation of end-of-day principal and interest-earned amounts,\ntimely review and ability to restrict access to accounts and release funds iteratively, daily reconciliation to the\ngeneral ledger, tax reporting, and identification of outstanding official items. A full hold occurs in Step 1 when\nrestricting access, whereas, a partial hold occurs iteratively, perhaps in Steps 4 and 7, when releasing insured funds\nup to the SMDIA while holding back the estimated uninsured amount. These fundamental processes are outside of\nthe scope of Part 370, but they are assumed to be fully functional as part of the Cl’s current business processes.\n\nIt is important to follow FDIC regulation 12 CFR 360.8 to determine the cutoff point used in calculating deposit and\nother liability account balances for insurance coverage purposes. A check posted to an account prior to the Cutoff\nPoint (as defined in section 360.8), but not yet collected by the depository institution at the time of failure, will be\nincluded as part of the Close-of-Business Account Balance Point (as defined in section 360.8). If a check has not\nbeen posted to an account at the Cutoff Point, the check should not be included in the Close-of-Business Account\nBalance. The ultimate treatment of items in transit at the time of failure will depend on the strategy used to\nresolve the failed bank. At the time of failure, the FDIC will implement decisions made as to the proper handling of\npending transactions including but not limited to incoming wires, bank-rejected items, incoming ACH, lockbox\npayments, and recurring receipts related to trust properties or businesses.\n\nPage | 14", "token_count": 752}

At failure, however, the initial aggregation discussed herein allows immediate\nliquidity for depositors with low-dollar accounts and alleviates system processing time. When the broker and\nother third-party files are received, all deposit accounts will be aggregated by ORC. The FDIC will use the Cl’s\nIT system to calculate deposit insurance as follows.\n\ne Initial Aggregation by Depositor: The first aggregation is done by the Cl at the depositor level. If the\ndepositor’s aggregate balance at a Cl is no more than the SMDIA, then all the funds the account\nholder has at a Cl are fully insured and do not require aggregation by ownership right and capacity.\nHowever, as iterative processing of accounts occurs past the initial aggregation, all accounts should\nbe aggregated on an iterative basis to ensure there is no overpayment of insurance and to identify\naccounts by ownership right and capacity that might increase above SMDIA as new account\ninformation comes in.\n\ne Aggregation by Ownership Right & Capacity: The second step of aggregation is at the ORC level. Ifa\ndepositor’s aggregate balances exceed the SMDIA, the balances must be aggregated by ORC for a\ndeposit insurance determination, as required by law.\n\ne Calculate Insurance: Calculate insurance as outlined in Section 4 of this Guide.\n\ne Release funds up to the SMDIA: Insured funds will be released iteratively as the insurance\ndeterminations are completed. The hold on the estimated uninsured amount will remain, i.e., a\npartial hold, until all pending files are processed. Allocate insured and uninsured balances among\nbeneficial owners as outlined in Section 4.1.16 of this Guide.\n\nStep 5: Generate Output Files and Reports\n\nMajor Activity: Generate Output Files that will serve as the permanent record of the insurance determination\nfor the depositors at the time of closing, including accounts in a pending status.\n\nKey Inputs Key Outputs\n— Deposit Insurance Calculation — Customer File\n— Allocation of insured and uninsured balances among | — Account File\nbeneficial owners — Account Participant File\n— Pending File\n— Deposit Insurance Coverage Summary\nReport\n— Alternative Recordkeeping Entity Report\n(Optional)\n\nKey Steps: The following activities are conducted by the FDIC using the Cl’s system.\n\ne Generate Output Files: Generate the four Output Files required under Part 370, as further described\n\nin Section 5 and Appendix A of this Guide. The four Output Files are:\n\n— Customer File: The Customer File is used by the FDIC to capture information regarding the\nbeneficial owners\n\n— Account File: The Account File specifies the insured and uninsured balances available to each\ndepositor\n\n— Account Participant File: The Account Participant File identifies account participants, captures\nindicative information, and captures account participant allocations\n\n— Pending File: The Pending File captures accounts that require additional information before a\ndeposit insurance determination can be completed\n\nPage | 16", "token_count": 800}

(4) tax and insurance payments under (MSA), assuming the payment was from one person\n(not two people); (5) deposits styled as trusts but ineligible for coverage under the trust categories‘; and (6)\n\n2 Account holder shall be deemed as a depositor entitled to up to the SMDIA as provided for under the applicable ownership\ncategory.\n\n3 A deceased account holder may have multiple accounts at the bank in the single account ownership right and capacity\ncategory (SGL ORC). Accounts titled to the decedent or for the “estate of” the decedent, in the SGL category, should be\naggregated and insured up to the SMDIA.\n\n4 Part 370 recordkeeping and reporting should utilize ownership right and capacity codes “REV” and “IRR” for trust accounts\ninsured as described in §§ 330.10 and 330.13 until March 31, 2024. On and after April 1, 2024, Part 370 recordkeeping and\nreporting should utilize ownership right and capacity code “TST” for the combined revocable and irrevocable trust category set\nforth in the revision of § 330.10 that takes effect on April 1, 2024.\n\nPage | 19", "token_count": 785}

Alternative or contingent beneficiaries that depend on the death of primary beneficiaries are not\ntaken into account in calculating deposit insurance coverage, if the primary beneficiaries are alive, except\nin the case where a life estate beneficiary is identified. Some trusts identify a life estate beneficiary with\nremainder beneficiaries upon the death of the life estate beneficiary. For deposit insurance calculations,\neach grantor — life estate beneficiary pair is insured up to the SMDIA across all REV trusts at the same Cl.\nThe remainder beneficiaries are also considered primary beneficiaries.\n\nIf a grantor is deceased determine if the FDIC’s six-month rule applies. See 2.3.5. If it does, then continue to\nclassify the account as REV. If the six-month rule does not apply, then recognize the grantor’s death for\npurposes of ORC selection and insurance calculation. Under the REV ORC:\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nIf the REV is an informal revocable trust (e.g. POD account) with two grantors, then after the first grantor\ndies and the six-month rule expires, treat the account as a REV with one grantor.\n\nIf the REV is a formal revocable trust with two grantors, then after the first grantor dies and the six month\nrule expires, treat the account as a REV with one grantor (unless the terms of the trust agreement dictate\nthe trust be treated as an IRR).\n\nIdentify eligible unique primary beneficiaries.\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nIf all primary beneficiaries are deceased, then:\n\ni) If there are no substitute or contingent beneficiaries named in the revocable trust document for that\nprimary beneficiary, then\n\n(1) Funds associated with that revocable trust should be treated as funds in a single or joint account\nORC belonging to the trust grantor(s) and aggregated and insured with other accounts of the\ntrust grantor(s) in the corresponding ORC.\n\nii) If the trust document (or bank records for an informal revocable trust) indicates the interest\nassociated with a deceased primary beneficiary is passed to other beneficiaries (e.g., per stirpes® or\nper capita), determine the eligibility of the successor beneficiaries and the total number of unique\neligible beneficiaries (including eligible successor beneficiaries) for purposes of deposit insurance\ncalculation.\n\nIf some primary beneficiaries are deceased and there is no contingency for the deceased beneficiaries,\nthen determine the number of eligible beneficiaries by counting the number of living primary\nbeneficiaries (identified in the trust agreement or, for informal trust, in bank records). For example, if a\nPOD account identifies three primary beneficiaries but one dies (without contingent beneficiaries), then\nthe trust has two eligible beneficiaries.\n\nFor payable-on death (“POD”) and formal revocable trust account.\n\ni) If a beneficiary is ineligible, ® then the beneficiary should be ignored for purposes of deposit insurance\ncalculation under REV.\n\n(1) Funds associated with that ineligible beneficiary should be treated as funds in a single account\n(SGL_ORC) for the grantor and aggregated with other SGL accounts the grantor has at the same\nCl. For example, if A and B co-own a POD revocable, name a corporation as the beneficiary, and\nhave $300,000 on deposit, then half the account ($150,000) is treated as A’s SGL ORC and the\n\n5 Per stirpes implies the estate of the deceased primary beneficiary is to be distributed to each branch of the family in equal share.\n6 An ineligible beneficiary does not meet the requirements of an eligible beneficiary but is still able to legally receive the bequest\nunder state law. Examples of ineligible beneficiaries include for-profit business entities and pet trusts. For purposes of calculating\ndeposit insurance coverage, the funds associated with an ineligible beneficiary is reverted to funds in the SGL right and capacity\nof the grantor(s).\n\nPage | 22", "token_count": 1031}

If a depositor designates as beneficiary a formal\nrevocable trust wholly owned by the depositor/accountholder, the FDIC will insure the deposit as a\nrevocable trust account. In such case, the FDIC will consider the beneficiaries of the trust to be the\nbeneficiaries of the POD account and will insure the account as if it were titled in the name of the\n\n9 Per stirpes implies the estate of the deceased primary beneficiary is to be distributed to each branch of the family in equal share.\n10 An ineligible beneficiary does not meet the requirements of an eligible beneficiary but is still able to legally receive the bequest\nunder state law.

FDIC has developed an order of allocating uninsured funds when debiting the uninsured funds\nto reduce the burden and disruption of pending transactions to depositors that might have accounts that need\nadjustment based on the Allocation of Uninsured Funds. This is generally the same for most ownership categories,\nexcept jointly owned and trust accounts, discussed in detail below. Under this practice, the uninsured amount is\napplied based on the account product type in the following order of allocation: CDS, SAV, MMA, NOW, and DDA.\nThe rationale for this order is based on time and savings accounts historically having the fewest pending\ntransactions as opposed to demand deposit accounts being used regularly for day-to-day funding needs.\n\nIf an account is joint and not titled to a trust, uninsured amounts are debited on a pro-rata basis based on the coowner's share percentage regardless of the account product type. The pro rata uninsured application is used for\njoint accounts to ensure a fully insured joint owner is not disproportionately affected.\n\nFor trust accounts, uninsured amounts are first debited from formal trusts and subsequent debits are then applied\nto informal trust accounts (In Trust For or Payable on Death). Even if a trust account (formal or informal) might\nend up being a jointly owned account, it follows the suggested debiting order because the trust account category\nallows for accounts to have a single owner or multiple owners.\n\nIf there are equal account types within a depositor’s ownership category when trying to determine the debiting\norder, for example, two CD accounts, the uninsured amount is debited first from the highest balance where the\n\naccount type is the same. If the balances are the same, then the lowest account number is levied first.\n\nAfter the deposit insurance calculation is completed, uninsured funds could be debited from accounts in the\nfollowing order to minimize the impact on depositors:\n\nCertificate of deposit\nSavings account\nMoney market account\n\nNegotiable order of withdrawal\n\nnu PF wr PF\n\nDemand deposit account\n\nIf a depositor has only one uninsured account, the calculation of the debit amount is simply subtracting the insured\namount from the total balance (principal plus accrued interest).\n\nPage | 41", "token_count": 900}

Appendix A\nidentifies the data fields that may be populated with a null value. Part 370 requires that each Cl will provide all\ninformation described in Appendix A unless noted otherwise. If a data field is allowed a null value per Appendix A, it\nshould be represented by two consecutive pipe delimiters and the account should not be placed in the Pending File.\n\nAll Output Files contain the CS_Unique_ID field which should be unique to each Cl depositor and provide a common\nkey linking all files. The Account Participant File is linked to the Account File by the CS_Unique_ID, the\nDP_Right_Capacity, and the DP_Acct_Identifier. The file relationships should conform to the following rules:\n\n— _ Each account represented in the Account File or the Account Participant File should have a corresponding\ncustomer record in the Customer File.\n\n— _ Each account represented on the Account Participant File should have a corresponding account on the Account\nFile.\n\n— _ Each Account on the Pending File should not appear on the Account File, except in the case of pass-through\naccounts.\n\n— Each Account Participant that is also a Customer of the Cl should have the same AP_Participant_ID as its\nCS_Unique_ID at the Cl.\n\nFor alternative record-keeping files, the CS_GOVT_ID, namely the social security number or tax identification number\nshould be the preferred linking field.

These files\nmust be prepared in successive iterations as the FDIC receives additional data from external sources necessary to\ncomplete the deposit insurance determinations, and, as it updates pending determinations. The files will be\ncomprised of the following four tables.

If a null value is allowed in a field,\nthe record should not be placed in the Pending File.\n\nA null value, as indicated in the table below, is allowed for fields that are not immediately needed to calculate deposit\ninsurance. To ensure timely calculations for depositor liquidity purposes, the information with null-value designations\ncan be obtained after the initial deposit insurance calculation. As due diligence for recordkeeping progresses\nthroughout the years of ongoing compliance, the FDIC expects that the banks will continue efforts to capture the nullvalue designations and populate the output file to alleviate the burden at the time of bank failure.\n\nCustomer File\n\nThe Customer File will be used by the FDIC to identify the customers.

Under Part 370, each covered institution must configure its IT system to be capable of accurately calculating the deposit\ninsurance available for each deposit account in accordance with the FDIC’s deposit insurance rules set forth in 12 CFR part 330 (“Part\n330”), should the Cl fail. In the event of the Cl’s failure, the FDIC would use the Cl’s IT system to calculate the amount of deposit\ninsurance available and debit the uninsured amount from each deposit account (collectively, the “deposit insurance\ndetermination”).\n\nPart 370 recognizes that an insured depository institution may not be required to maintain all of the information needed by the FDIC\nto calculate the entire amount of deposit insurance available to each depositor with respect to certain types of deposit accounts\nunder the existing regulatory framework. For that reason, Cls are permitted, under Section 370.4(b) (“alternative recordkeeping\nrequirements”), to maintain less information in their deposit account records for certain types of deposit accounts than otherwise\nrequired under Part 370. To meet the alternative recordkeeping requirements, the Cl must maintain in its deposit account records\ncertain information that will facilitate the FDIC’s prompt collection of the additional information needed to calculate the full amount\nof deposit insurance available for those deposit accounts after the Cl’s failure. These alternative recordkeeping requirements apply\nto, among other things, certain deposit accounts that would be insured on a “‘pass-through” basis (such as brokered deposits),\nbecause beneficial ownership information is not required to be maintained by the covered institution, and to certain deposit\naccounts for which the amount of insurance is dependent on additional facts (such as deposit accounts held in connection with a\ntrust).\n\nThe protocol described in this addendum, or an alternative approach, capable of supporting this deposit insurance calculation within\ntwenty-four (24) hours following failure must be in place. Compliance with the recommended practices and standards set forth in\nthis Addendum is voluntary and noncompliance therewith will not, in itself, result in enforcement action.\n\nDeposit Broker’s Processing Guide\n\nThe FDIC has an established process for collecting such information in the event of such an institution’s failure, which is described in\nthis Deposit Broker’s Processing Guide (“DBPG”). This DPBG supplies a file format and process for submitting the information and\nsupporting documentation necessary for the FDIC to receive and process the information from brokers to properly perform its\nresponsibilities to make insured funds available to depositors in a timely manner. This process includes a number of manual\nprocesses and forms (declarations and an affidavit). The same process may also be used to collect information from account holders\nother than deposit brokers whose deposits are eligible for pass-through deposit insurance coverage. In the event of a Cl’s failure,\nperforming these processes manually for a large number of deposit accounts insured on a pass-through basis would likely result in\nsubstantial delays in the deposit insurance determination and the availability of insured funds.\n\nPart 370 Addendum\n\nBased on feedback from users of the current DBPG, the primary objective of this addendum is to accelerate the deposit insurance\ncalculation by modernizing the process without substantive deviations from the existing established processes by:\ne = Providing an optional standard file structure and data format for adoption by those covered institutions and their account\nholders;\ne Permitting iterative submissions and partial insurance determinations as information becomes available;\ne = Allowing declarations from the underlying beneficial owners of deposits to be submitted electronically. As a result, the\noptional standard file structure and data format:\noO minimally expands the data elements included in the standard file;\n\nPage | 70", "token_count": 1089}

Where\nsufficient account information has been received to enable it to do so, the Cl’s system will make additional deposit insurance determinations for\nthose pass-through accounts. The Cl’s system will then generate updated Part 370 Customer, Account, and Account Participant output files\nwhich incorporate the additional insurance determinations. If an ARE has not provided all the information necessary for a complete insurance\ndetermination on its deposit, the Cl’s system will also generate a Pending output file record representing the balance of the ARE’s deposit.\n\nCustomer Output File (Time Period 3)\n\nThe Customer output file contains one record for each unique depositor known to the Cl. As in Time Period 1, the Cl will populate each direct\ndeposit account owner’s record with information from the Cl’s depositor records. When it receives additional account owner information from\nindirect (ARE) depositors, additional records will be added to the Customer output file for any newly-identified account owners, each with a\n“CS_Unique_ID” (e.g., the account owner’s Tax ID number).\n\n>In this example,\nA. Anytown Broker is an existing customer at the Cl.\nB. Marci Jones is an existing customer at the Cl.\nC. XYZ Corporation is an existing customer at the Cl.\nD. Anywhere City is not an existing customer at the Cl but has been identified as an account owner in Anytown Broker’s ARE submission file.\n\nE. John Smith (Trustee of The Smith Family Trust) is also not an existing customer at the Cl but has been identified as an account owner in\nAnytown Broker’s ARE submission file.\n\nThere will be no changes in the Customer output\nfile for these three existing customers of the Cl.\n\nFor insurance determination purposes only, a new customer record for (D) and (E) should be added to the Customer output file. The Government\nID of the account owner may be used as the “CS_Unique_ID” unless the Cl has already assigned that “CS_Unique_ID” to another existing customer\n— in which case the Cl should assign a different “CS_Unique_ID” to the newly-identified account owner.\n\nPage | 81", "token_count": 592}
