          "enhanced_query": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to rewrite their query to make it clearer and better for retrieval. The original query is \"Compare chunking in v1 and v2 and explain indexing changes in phase 4.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what they're asking. They want a comparison between chunking methods in versions 1 and 2, and an explanation of how indexing changed in phase 4. The user probably wants a detailed analysis, so the query should be specific enough to get accurate results.\n\nThe original query is a bit vague. Words like \"chunking\" and \"indexing changes\" might be too general. Maybe adding context like \"implementation\" or \"methodology\" could help. Also, specifying that they want a side-by-side comparison might make it clearer. \n\nI should make sure to preserve the meaning. They mentioned \"v1\" and \"v2,\" so I should keep those as versions. \"Phase 4\" is specific, so that's good. Maybe rephrase \"explain indexing changes\" to something like \"elaborate on the modifications to the indexing process\" to be more precise.\n\nAlso, using \"differences\" instead of \"compare\" might be more direct. The user might be looking for a structured comparison, so terms like \"side-by-side analysis\" could help. For the indexing part, specifying \"modifications to the indexing process\" adds clarity.\n\nI need to check if there are any technical terms that should be included. If \"chunking\" refers to a specific process in their context, maybe adding that context would help, but the user said not to add new information. So stick to what's given.\n\nPutting it all together: \"Compare the chunking methodologies in version 1 and version 2, and elaborate on the modifications to the indexing process in phase 4.\" That should be clearer and more precise for retrieval.\n</think>\n\nRevised Query:  \n\"Compare the chunking methodologies in version 1 and version 2, and elaborate on the modifications to the indexing process in phase 4.\"",
